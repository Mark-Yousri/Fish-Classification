## Introduction
This project is a demonstration of how to use different deep learning models to classify images of fish and other marine animals. The project uses three models: ResNet50, Xception, and VGG19, and compares their performance on a dataset of 1162 training images and 308 validation images belonging to 5 classes: fish, jelly, shark, tuna, and whale.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:

- os
- tensorflow
- cv2
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:

## Usage
To run this project, you will need to download the dataset from [here] and unzip it in the same directory as the code. Then, you can open the `classification.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially. The code will load the data, create the models, train them, and save them in the `kaggle/working` directory. You can also use the `classify_moves` function to test the models on new images.

## Results
The project shows the training and validation accuracy and loss curves for each model, as well as some examples of correct and incorrect predictions. The best performing model is Xception, which achieves 96.75% validation accuracy and 0.4329 validation loss. The worst performing model is ResNet50, which achieves 73.96% validation accuracy and 0.7813 validation loss. The VGG19 model is in between, with 85.06% validation accuracy and 0.4874 validation loss.
